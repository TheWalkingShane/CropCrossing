# CropCrossing
Team: Jesus Morfin, Joshua Lawson, Marcos Arroyo, Reece Whitelaw

1) What is the problem being solved /question asked?
    - How to crossbreed crops in a way that maximizes their utility.

2) What does the player get to do?
    - The player gets to create crossbreeds of crops to find high quality combinations
    - Collect crossbred crops and see how they perform in various season
    - Work towards producing more valuable crops
    - Use money from selling crop yields to purchase additional crossbreeding options and gain more seeds

3) What are the constraints?
     [Limitations]  
        - A menu for cross breeding crops
        - An area for growing crops 
        - Seeing all crops collected(from breeding)
    [Currency]
        - Money earned from selling crops
        - Number of crops collected

4) What are the Controls?
    - Mouse(Drag items into the box), MouseWheel

 5) Any performance limits?
    - No limit performance

6) How will the command pattern be implemented?
    - The command pattern will be used for the player to have the option to redo the same combination of crops previously used, or to undo before taking action.

7) What assets will you need?
    - Pixel art of the crops
    - Basic art for the main play screen
    - Sound Effects

8) Who is assigned what roles?
    - First week for GitHub integrator will be Jesus then rotate. 
    [Reece] will be handling the art assets and incorporating code to display the crossbreeds, which will visually combine the traits from both parent plants
    [Joshua] will implement a framework in which plants can easily be added and interact with one another.
    [Marcos] will handle most menu features and controls.
    [Jesus] will introduce visual tweaks, art assets (outside of the vegetables), and a basic seasonal-tracker that we can fully implement as we go progress.

9) When will things be completed/what are your milestones?
    - Milestone 1) Framework for drag-and-drop controls that combine vegetables. Vegetables in this case will be unfinished and act simply as stand ins for proof of concept.
    - Milestone 2) Introduce the traits fruits and vegetables have. Nutritional value, visuals, yields should all be introduced for each plant. Create a basic formula system to determine how fruits and vegetables inherit traits from one another to produce a crossbreed, then produce said crossbreed.
    - Milestone 3) Expand on prior systems, add more vegetables, and refine the crossbreeding mechanic while tracking the value of plants grown.
    - Milestone 4) Introduce seasonal modifiers, saved crossbreeds, total value grown tracker, finalize product.

10) What is your future ideas list?
    - Adding a locust swarm
    - Natural Disasters.
    - Balancing soil usage.
